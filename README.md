We'll be programming the ESP8266 wifi chip.  It resides on the sparkfun dev board: https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13711

Install Arduino 1.6.11 from here: https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/OldSoftwareReleases#previous

Follow the directions by sparkfun to add the json board files from the Arduino Board Manager menu: https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/esp8266-thing-development-board-hookup-guide/setting-up-arduino

Create a directory in your My Documnets called Arduion.  Add the esp8266fs.jar file to the directory Arduino/tools/ESP8266FS/tool/esp8266fs.jar
This file allows you to upload html and js data files to your Arduino. There are no folders though. The file is here:https://github.com/esp8266/arduino-esp8266fs-plugin/releases/tag/0.2.0
